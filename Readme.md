# Goal
This project provides a initial pelican configs and theme files to offer a painless experience to publish jupyter notebooks as pelican blogs.

# Adaptations
Although pelican has ipynb plugin to convert .ipynb file into blog html, many adaptations have to be made to support jupyter notebook bloggin.

primary adaptations

* .ipynb files seldomly exist alone, they usually work with related static files such as test data, images, etc. They are better organized in  indivisual directorys. Pelicanconf.py is configured so that pelican can detect .ipynb files in directorys and the links are not broken after they are converted into html
* In .ipynb generated html, contents are nested deeply in <div> elements so some javascript plugins such as tocify.js cannot work properly. So scripts are added in article template to properly extract content from the nested <div> block
* 'Clean-blog' theme in pelican provides a clean, good looking but provide too little useful component common to blogs, such as
    * Duoshuo Comments (disqus is blocked for chinese users)
    * Responsive sidebar toc menu
    * Menus for category, tag, archives
    * Wechat reward image

# Usage
## custom.py
create a custom.py file (same folder with pelicanconf.py) and add the following content
```
AUTHOR = 'YourName'
SITENAME = "YourSiteName"
DUOSHUO_PREFIX = 'YourSiteUrl'
DUOSHUO_SITENAME = <your duoshuo site name>
GITHUB_URL = <your github url>
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS = 'UA-xxxxxxxx-x' #Your google analytics id
ARTICLE_PATHS = ['articles'] # your article paths, relative to PATH in pelicanconf.py. See examples below

```

For example, here we have files structured like this

```
content
|   articles
    |   jupyter_labs
        |   labs_A
            |   article_0
                |   article0.ipynb
                |   article0.ipynb-meta
            |   article_1
                |   article1.ipynb
                |   article1.ipynb-meta
        |   labs_B

    |   lifes
        |   article_2
            |   article2.ipynb
            |   article2.ipynb-meta
|   posts
```

And we only want to publish contents in directory labs_A and lifes to blog posts, then set ARTICLE_PATHS as
```
ARTICLE_PATHS = ['articles/jupyter_labs/labs_A','articles/lifes']
```

## Replace images
Images are stored under "/themes/pelican-clean-blog/static/images"

* home-bg.jpg: Used for blog background
* award.jpeg: Used for wechat payment qr code image at the bottom of each article. I appreciate it very much if you keep my payment qr code:)

## .ipybn-meta
Pelican needs an extra .ipynb-meta file to publish .ipynb file in to blog html.

For example: 
To publish pytest_intro.ipynb file as blog, keep a pytest_intro.ipybn-meta file in the same directory like below

```
pytest_intro
|   pytest_intro.ipynb
|   pytest_intro.ipynb-meta
```

Within the pytest_intro.ipynb-meta, add contents like this.
```

```

'Id' is a number assigned to each blog and should be kept unqiue among all blogs, or comments system like DUOSHUO won't work properly.



# Notes
Don't forget to delete .ipynb_checkpoints files before run ```pelican``` command
